# Move File to Directory Script

This script moves a file named "betty" from the "/tmp/" directory to the "/tmp/my_first_directory" directory. It is a simple script that you can run on a Unix-like system.

## Prerequisites

- This script requires a Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS) to run.
- You need to have appropriate permissions to move files within the "/tmp/" directory and create directories within the "/tmp/" directory.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:

    ```shell
    mv /tmp/betty /tmp/my_first_directory/
