# Create a Directory Script

This script creates a directory named "my_first_directory" within the "/tmp/" directory. It is a simple script that you can run on a Unix-like system.

## Prerequisites

- This script requires a Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS) to run.
- You need to have appropriate permissions to create directories within the "/tmp/" directory.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:

    ```
    mkdir /tmp/my_first_directory/
