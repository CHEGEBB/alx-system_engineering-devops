### Overview

This project aims to implement web stack monitoring using Datadog, a monitoring and analytics platform. Monitoring is crucial in the tech industry to ensure the smooth operation of software systems and servers. The project involves setting up Datadog, configuring monitors, and creating dashboards to visualize key metrics.
